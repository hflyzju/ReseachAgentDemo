    "abstract": "In this paper, we show that popular Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) exacerbate biases along the axes of gender and skin tone when given a skewed distribution of face-shots. While practitioners celebrate synthetic data generation using GANs as an economical way to augment data for training data-hungry machine learning models, it is unclear whether they recognize the perils of such techniques when applied to real world datasets biased along latent dimensions. Specifically, we show that (1) traditional GANs further skew the distribution of a dataset consisting of engineering faculty headshots, generating minority modes less often and of worse quality and (2) image-to-image translation (conditional) GANs also exacerbate biases by lightening skin color of non-white faces and transforming female facial features to be masculine when generating faces of engineering professors. Thus, our study is meant to serve as a cautionary tale."
