    "title": "WundtGPT: Shaping Large Language Models To Be An Empathetic, Proactive Psychologist",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are raging over the medical domain, and their momentum has carried over into the mental health domain, leading to the emergence of few mental health LLMs. Although such mental health LLMs could provide reasonable suggestions for psychological counseling, how to develop an authentic and effective doctor-patient relationship (DPR) through LLMs is still an important problem. To fill this gap, we dissect DPR into two key attributes, i.e., the psychologist's empathy and proactive guidance. We thus present WundtGPT, an empathetic and proactive mental health large language model that is acquired by fine-tuning it with instruction and real conversation between psychologists and patients. It is designed to assist psychologists in diagnosis and help patients who are reluctant to communicate face-to-face understand their psychological conditions. Its uniqueness lies in that it could not only pose purposeful questions to guide patients in detailing their symptoms but also offer warm emotional reassurance. In particular, WundtGPT incorporates Collection of Questions, Chain of Psychodiagnosis, and Empathy Constraints into a comprehensive prompt for eliciting LLMs' questions and diagnoses. Additionally, WundtGPT proposes a reward model to promote alignment with empathetic mental health professionals, which encompasses two key factors: cognitive empathy and emotional empathy. We offer a comprehensive evaluation of our proposed model. Based on these outcomes, we further conduct the manual evaluation based on proactivity, effectiveness, professionalism and coherence. We notice that WundtGPT can offer professional and effective consultation. The model is available at huggingface.",

        "Large language models (LLMs) have performed well in providing general and extensive health suggestions in single-turn conversations, exemplified by systems such as ChatGPT, ChatGLM, ChatDoctor, DoctorGLM, and etc. However, the limited information provided by users during single turn results in inadequate personalization and targeting of the generated suggestions, which requires users to independently select the useful part. It is mainly caused by the missing ability to engage in multi-turn questioning. In real-world medical consultations, doctors usually employ a series of iterative inquiries to comprehend the patient's condition thoroughly, enabling them to provide effective and personalized suggestions subsequently, which can be defined as chain of questioning (CoQ) for LLMs. To improve the CoQ of LLMs, we propose BianQue, a ChatGLM-based LLM finetuned with the self-constructed health conversation dataset BianQueCorpus that is consist of multiple turns of questioning and health suggestions polished by ChatGPT. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BianQue can simultaneously balance the capabilities of both questioning and health suggestions, which will help promote the research and application of LLMs in the field of proactive health.",
        "Great research interests have been attracted to devise AI services that are able to provide mental health support. However, the lack of corpora is a main obstacle to this research, particularly in Chinese language. In this paper, we propose PsyQA, a Chinese dataset of psychological health support in the form of question and answer pair. PsyQA is crawled from a Chinese mental health service platform, and contains 22K questions and 56K long and well-structured answers. Based on the psychological counseling theories, we annotate a portion of answer texts with typical strategies for providing support, and further present in-depth analysis of both lexical features and strategy patterns in the counseling answers. We also evaluate the performance of generating counseling answers with the generative pretrained models. Results show that utilizing strategies enhances the fluency and helpfulness of generated answers, but there is still a large space for future research.",
        "The recent progress of large language models (LLMs), including ChatGPT and GPT-4, in comprehending and responding to human instructions has been remarkable. Nevertheless, these models typically perform better in English and have not been explicitly trained for the medical domain, resulting in suboptimal precision in diagnoses, drug recommendations, and other medical advice. Additionally, training and deploying a dialogue model is still believed to be impossible for hospitals, hindering the promotion of LLMs. To tackle these challenges, we have collected databases of medical dialogues in Chinese with ChatGPT's help and adopted several techniques to train an easy-deploy LLM. Remarkably, we were able to fine-tune the ChatGLM-6B on a single A100 80G in 13 hours, which means having a healthcare-purpose LLM can be very affordable. DoctorGLM is currently an early-stage engineering attempt and contain various mistakes. We are sharing it with the broader community to invite feedback and suggestions to improve its healthcare-focused capabilities: this https URL."
