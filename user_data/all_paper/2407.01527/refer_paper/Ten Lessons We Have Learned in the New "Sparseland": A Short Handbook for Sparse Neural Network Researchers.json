    "title": "Ten Lessons We Have Learned in the New \"Sparseland\": A Short Handbook for Sparse Neural Network Researchers",
    "abstract": "This article does not propose any novel algorithm or new hardware for sparsity. Instead, it aims to serve the \"common good\" for the increasingly prosperous Sparse Neural Network (SNN) research community. We attempt to summarize some most common confusions in SNNs, that one may come across in various scenarios such as paper review/rebuttal and talks - many drawn from the authors' own bittersweet experiences! We feel that doing so is meaningful and timely, since the focus of SNN research is notably shifting from traditional pruning to more diverse and profound forms of sparsity before, during, and after training. The intricate relationships between their scopes, assumptions, and approaches lead to misunderstandings, for non-experts or even experts in SNNs. In response, we summarize ten Q\\&As of SNNs from many key aspects, including dense vs. sparse, unstructured sparse vs. structured sparse, pruning vs. sparse training, dense-to-sparse training vs. sparse-to-sparse training, static sparsity vs. dynamic sparsity, before-training/during-training vs. post-training sparsity, and many more. We strive to provide proper and generically applicable answers to clarify those confusions to the best extent possible. We hope our summary provides useful general knowledge for people who want to enter and engage with this exciting community; and also provides some \"mind of ease\" convenience for SNN researchers to explain their work in the right contexts. At the very least (and perhaps as this article's most insignificant target functionality), if you are writing/planning to write a paper or rebuttal in the field of SNNs, we hope some of our answers could help you!"
