To improve the capacities for narrative prompts, we propose a simple-yet-effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach called the Semantic Understanding and Reasoning adapter (SUR-adapter) for pre-trained diffusion models.

Then, we align the semantic representation of narrative prompts to the complex prompts and transfer knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to our SUR-adapter via knowledge distillation so that it can acquire the powerful semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities to build a high-quality textual semantic representation for text-to-image generation. We conduct experiments by integrating multiple LLMs and popular pre-trained diffusion models to show the effectiveness of our approach in enabling diffusion models to understand and reason concise natural language without image quality degradation.

    "problem_result": "Problem:  \nHow can we improve the personalization of text-to-image generation models by incorporating user feedback in real-time and adapting the model's responses accordingly, while maintaining the quality and relevance of the generated images?\n\n\nRationale: \nThe target paper and related studies have made significant strides in enhancing text-to-image generation models through personalized prompt rewriting, optimizing prompts, and semantic understanding. However, these models primarily rely on historical user interactions and manually engineered prompts. While these methods have shown promising results, they may not fully capture the dynamic and evolving preferences of users in real-time. Therefore, a potential research problem lies in developing a mechanism that allows text-to-image generation models to adapt to real-time user feedback. This could involve developing a feedback loop where the model not only generates images based on user prompts but also learns from user reactions to the generated images and adjusts its responses accordingly. This approach could potentially enhance the personalization of these models and ensure the generated images are more aligned with the users' vision. It is a feasible research problem as it builds upon existing methods of prompt rewriting and semantic understanding. It is also relevant and significant as it addresses a key challenge in the field of text-to-image generation, which is to create personalized visual representations that closely align with the desires and preferences of individual users.",
