    "title": "OMG: Towards Open-vocabulary Motion Generation via Mixture of Controllers",
    "abstract": "We have recently seen tremendous progress in realistic text-to-motion generation. Yet, the existing methods often fail or produce implausible motions with unseen text inputs, which limits the applications. In this paper, we present OMG, a novel framework, which enables compelling motion generation from zero-shot open-vocabulary text prompts. Our key idea is to carefully tailor the pretrain-then-finetune paradigm into the text-to-motion generation. At the pre-training stage, our model improves the generation ability by learning the rich out-of-domain inherent motion traits. To this end, we scale up a large unconditional diffusion model up to 1B parameters, so as to utilize the massive unlabeled motion data up to over 20M motion instances. At the subsequent fine-tuning stage, we introduce motion ControlNet, which incorporates text prompts as conditioning information, through a trainable copy of the pre-trained model and the proposed novel Mixture-of-Controllers (MoC) block. MoC block adaptively recognizes various ranges of the sub-motions with a cross-attention mechanism and processes them separately with the text-token-specific experts. Such a design effectively aligns the CLIP token embeddings of text prompts to various ranges of compact and expressive motion features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our OMG achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods on zero-shot text-to-motion generation. Project page: this https URL.",

        "Motion capture from a monocular video is fundamental and crucial for us humans to naturally experience and interact with each other in Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). However, existing methods still struggle with challenging cases involving self-occlusion and complex poses due to the lack of effective motion prior modeling. In this paper, we present a novel variational motion prior (VMP) learning approach for video-based motion capture to resolve the above issue. Instead of directly building the correspondence between the video and motion domain, We propose to learn a generic latent space for capturing the prior distribution of all natural motions, which serve as the basis for subsequent video-based motion capture tasks. To improve the generalization capacity of prior space, we propose a transformer-based variational autoencoder pretrained over marker-based 3D mocap data, with a novel style-mapping block to boost the generation quality. Afterward, a separate video encoder is attached to the pretrained motion generator for end-to-end fine-tuning over task-specific video datasets. Compared to existing motion prior models, our VMP model serves as a motion rectifier that can effectively reduce temporal jittering and failure modes in frame-wise pose estimation, leading to temporally stable and visually realistic motion capture results. Furthermore, our VMP-based framework models motion at sequence level and can directly generate motion clips in the forward pass, achieving real-time motion capture during inference. Extensive experiments over both public datasets and in-the-wild videos have demonstrated the efficacy and generalization capability of our framework.",
        "We have recently seen tremendous progress in diffusion advances for generating realistic human motions. Yet, they largely disregard the multi-human interactions. In this paper, we present InterGen, an effective diffusion-based approach that incorporates human-to-human interactions into the motion diffusion process, which enables layman users to customize high-quality two-person interaction motions, with only text guidance. We first contribute a multimodal dataset, named InterHuman. It consists of about 107M frames for diverse two-person interactions, with accurate skeletal motions and 23,337 natural language descriptions. For the algorithm side, we carefully tailor the motion diffusion model to our two-person interaction setting. To handle the symmetry of human identities during interactions, we propose two cooperative transformer-based denoisers that explicitly share weights, with a mutual attention mechanism to further connect the two denoising processes. Then, we propose a novel representation for motion input in our interaction diffusion model, which explicitly formulates the global relations between the two performers in the world frame. We further introduce two novel regularization terms to encode spatial relations, equipped with a corresponding damping scheme during the training of our interaction diffusion model. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and generalizability of InterGen. Notably, it can generate more diverse and compelling two-person motions than previous methods and enables various downstream applications for human interactions.",
        "Mixtures of Experts combine the outputs of several \"expert\" networks, each of which specializes in a different part of the input space. This is achieved by training a \"gating\" network that maps each input to a distribution over the experts. Such models show promise for building larger networks that are still cheap to compute at test time, and more parallelizable at training time. In this this work, we extend the Mixture of Experts to a stacked model, the Deep Mixture of Experts, with multiple sets of gating and experts. This exponentially increases the number of effective experts by associating each input with a combination of experts at each layer, yet maintains a modest model size. On a randomly translated version of the MNIST dataset, we find that the Deep Mixture of Experts automatically learns to develop location-dependent (\"where\") experts at the first layer, and class-specific (\"what\") experts at the second layer. In addition, we see that the different combinations are in use when the model is applied to a dataset of speech monophones. These demonstrate effective use of all expert combinations."
