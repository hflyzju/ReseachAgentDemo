    "title": "Filter & Align: Curating Image-Text Data with Human Knowledge",
    "abstract": "The increasing availability of image-text pairs has largely fueled the rapid advancement in vision-language foundation models. However, the vast scale of these datasets inevitably introduces significant variability in data quality, which can adversely affect the model performance. This highlights the critical role of data filtering, not only to enhance training efficiency but also to improve overall data quality. Existing methods typically rely on metrics such as CLIP Score and BLIP Score, which are derived from pre-trained models. However, these models are often trained on uncurated, noisy datasets, which can perpetuate errors and misalignments in the filtered dataset. We present a novel algorithm that incorporates human knowledge on image-text alignment to guide filtering vast corpus of web-crawled image-text datasets into a compact and high-quality form. To systemically capture human preferences on image-text alignments, we collect a diverse image-text dataset where each image is associated with multiple captions from various sources, and establish a comprehensive set of both subjective and objective criteria for critically guiding the alignment assessment from labelers. Additionally, we train a reward model on these human-preference annotations to internalize the nuanced human understanding of image-text alignment. The resulting reward model thus can act as a human-like referee to filter image-text pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that we can maintain, sometimes even improve, model performance while compressing the image-text datasets up to ~90%. An impressive example is that, by aggressively reducing the total training sample from 130M to only 15.5M, our BLIP-B/16 models consistently show an average improvement of 2.9% on retrieval tasks and 11.5% on captioning tasks compared to full-size-dataset counterparts."
