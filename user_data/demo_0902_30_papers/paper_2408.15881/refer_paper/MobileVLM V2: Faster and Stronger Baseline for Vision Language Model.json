    "title": "MobileVLM V2: Faster and Stronger Baseline for Vision Language Model",
    "abstract": "We introduce MobileVLM V2, a family of significantly improved vision language models upon MobileVLM, which proves that a delicate orchestration of novel architectural design, an improved training scheme tailored for mobile VLMs, and rich high-quality dataset curation can substantially benefit VLMs' performance. Specifically, MobileVLM V2 1.7B achieves better or on-par performance on standard VLM benchmarks compared with much larger VLMs at the 3B scale. Notably, our 3B model outperforms a large variety of VLMs at the 7B+ scale. Our models will be released at this https URL ."
