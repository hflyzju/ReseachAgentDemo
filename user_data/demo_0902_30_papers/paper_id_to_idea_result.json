This paper introduces RealTimeVLM, a novel domain-specific VLM designed to address these challenges. Our approach involves the creation of a unique dataset comprising high-resolution remote sensing images from various disaster scenarios, annotated with region-specific dialogues, questions, and answers. We then develop RealTimeVLM, an advanced model based on the architecture of GeoChat, but with an additional module for real-time data processing and response generation. The model is trained using a combination of supervised learning for the annotated dialogues and reinforcement learning for real-time response generation. We evaluate the model's performance using a separate test set from the newly created dataset and compare its performance with GeoChat and other baseline methods. Finally, we apply RealTimeVLM in a simulated disaster management scenario to test its practical applicability and effectiveness. Our results demonstrate the potential of RealTimeVLM to significantly improve disaster response efforts by providing real-time data processing and immediate responses to user queries.",

However, existing frameworks, such as the Open-vocabulary Motion Generation (OMG), do not adequately consider multi-human interactions, limiting their applicability in complex social scenarios. This paper introduces Interaction-OMG (I-OMG), a novel method that integrates multi-human interactions into the OMG framework. We adapt the InterGen diffusion model for two-person interaction settings and incorporate it into the OMG framework, extending its applicability to more complex scenarios. Our method involves a series of steps including interaction data preprocessing, development of an interaction diffusion model, integration of the model into OMG, and fine-tuning and validation of the integrated model. We validate our approach through extensive experiments using the InterHuman dataset, demonstrating the ability of I-OMG to generate realistic and applicable motions in complex social scenarios. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting its potential for enhancing the realism and applicability of generated motions in various applications.",

This paper proposes a novel, multi-stage, self-supervised learning approach to improve the robustness and accuracy of semantic correspondence estimation. The method involves pretraining a Vision Transformer (ViT) model on a large-scale, diverse dataset, fine-tuning the model with a weak geometric spherical prior for 3D understanding, and introducing a post-processing step that uses a deep learning model for keypoint detection. Each stage of the method is validated through rigorous experiments using the SPair-71k dataset, a large-scale benchmark for semantic correspondence. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of semantic correspondence estimation in complex images, providing a promising direction for future research in this field.",
