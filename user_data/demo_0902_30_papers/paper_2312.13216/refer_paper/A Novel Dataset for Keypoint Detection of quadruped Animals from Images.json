    "title": "A Novel Dataset for Keypoint Detection of quadruped Animals from Images",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we studied the problem of localizing a generic set of keypoints across multiple quadruped or four-legged animal species from images. Due to the lack of large scale animal keypoint dataset with ground truth annotations, we developed a novel dataset, AwA Pose, for keypoint detection of quadruped animals from images. Our dataset contains significantly more keypoints per animal and has much more diverse animals than the existing datasets for animal keypoint detection. We benchmarked the dataset with a state-of-the-art deep learning model for different keypoint detection tasks, including both seen and unseen animal cases. Experimental results showed the effectiveness of the dataset. We believe that this dataset will help the computer vision community in the design and evaluation of improved models for the generalized quadruped animal keypoint detection problem."
